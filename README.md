Original code and repo by jrra. I just forked it to make it easier to build and to later use for my own shenanigans.

Requires a mips64-elf toolchain. Libdragon's toolchain seems to work just fine.
To build clone repo and all submodules.
Download bass-14 from `https://github.com/ARM9/bass/releases/tag/v14` and extract the source code to `external/`.
Placee the USA stadium2 rom in the folder as `np3e0,z64` and the JPN rom as `np3j0.z64`.
